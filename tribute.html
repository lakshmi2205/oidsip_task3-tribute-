      <h3>NR Narayana Murthy life's Timeline</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><b> August 20, 1946 :</b> Born in Sidlaghatta</li>
        <p>Nagavara Ramarao Narayana Murthy CBE, LH is an Indian
          billionaire businessman. He is one of the seven co-founders of Infosys, and has previously served as the
          chairman, chief executive officer (CEO), president, and chief mentor of the company before retiring and
          taking the title chairman emeritus. As of April 2023, his net worth was estimated to be $4.1 billion,
          making him the 711th richest person in the world according to Forbes.</p>
        <p>Murthy stepped down as chairman in 2011 after 30 years with the company but returned in 2013 to hand over
          management to a professional CEO in 2014.
          In 2017, Murthy was in the news for raising concerns over alleged corporate governance lapses at Infosys,
          which the company denied.
          The controversy led to the CEO's resignation and a board shakeup, which saw the return of retired cofounder
          Nandan Nilekani as nonexecutive chairman.
          In August 2021, his private investment firm Catamaran Ventures agreed to sell its stake in a joint venture
          with Amazon India.</p>

        <p>From an early age Murthy displayed signs of greatness and received his education from one of the top
          technological institutions in India. Before venturing to become an entrepreneur he had worked with Patni
          Computer Systems in Pune. He had always dreamed of becoming an entrepreneur and hoped to form a big company
          which would create job opportunities for the country’s youngsters. Blessed with a brilliant mind and astute
          business sense, he formed Infosys with six other software professionals including Nandan Nilekani and N. S.
          Raghavan with an initial capital of just Rs. 10, 000. Over the years the company grew manifold to become one
          of the top IT services companies based in India. His company’s contribution to the growth of the IT sector in
          India has been immense and the ‘Time’ magazine described him as the “Father of Indian IT Sector”. He has been
          honored with several awards for his contribution to the Indian industrial sector.</p>
        <p>During the 1990s Infosys focused on factors like Banking and Financial Services (BFSI), manufacturing,
          application development, maintenance, and testing. These all helped Infosys become a pioneer in the IT sector.

        <p>The journey towards entrepreneurship
          It was a very interesting incident that pushed Muruthy toward becoming an entrepreneur. As Narayan shared
          leftist values he was once traveling by train and talked to a girl with French while passing through Nis, a
          town bordering Serbia and Bulgaria, and got arrested for 72 hrs with luggage and passport seized and left only
          because he was Indian. This led him to join the capitalist world.

          The role of his partner?
          His father-in-law rejected him due to his entrepreneurial mindset.

          During this tenure, he started the venture of Softronics- an IT firm for the domestic market. which shut down
          after 1.5 years.

          All of these compelled him to join Patni Computer Systems as the General Manager. This opened his gate to
          marry Sudha Murthy a year later in 1978.

          Sudha helped him in all aspects from lending Rs. 10,000 from her savings and a duration of 3 years to explore
          the business world to household work.

          How Infosys was created
          In January 1981, Narayan had a meeting with 6 of his software engineering friends at his apartment to create a
          company. Consequently, Infosys Consultants Pvt. Ltd. was founded on 2nd July 1981.

          The names behind the company were Narayana Murthy, Nandan Nilekani, N. S. Raghavan, S. Gopalakrishnan, S. D.
          Shibulal, K. Dinesh, and Ashok Arora. Murthy’s house became an office. All 6 bought different skills and
          experiences for Infosys. There were fights and disagreements also but they always kept the company ahead of
          themselves. From the initial time, the team always considered the interests of the company ahead of their own
          interests. And each of the team members brought different skills and experiences to the company.

          The boon Liberalisation of the Indian Economy in the 90s
          Today Infosys is an MNC that provides services from It, consultation services to business to outsourcing . For
          the financial year 2020-21, Infosys generated revenues of $14 billion with a net profit of $2.7 billion. In
          current times Narayan Murthy is an inspiring figure for all due to his determination, knowledge, experience,
          vision for entrepreneurship and the IT industry, and how his failure did not adhere to his goal and how he
          learned from it.</p>
